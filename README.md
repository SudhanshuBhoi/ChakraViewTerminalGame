## Setup

Although the game is ready to run, to get a "full, emmersive experience", check whether the function to clear the screen suits your OS.

### For Linux
Linux based system use `std::system("clear")` to clear your terminal screen from cpp code. This code was originaly built using a Linux based system and should work "out of the box".

### For Windows
Windows based system use `std::system("cls")` to clear your terminal screen from cpp code. To make this change, simply, open the code in any text editor, search for `"clear"` and replace it with `"cls"`. There should be 2 places to change.


## Usage

Step 1: Compile the source code  
`g++ ChakraView.cpp -o play`

Step 2: Get a friend to Play  
`./play`

Enjoy your game. **Remember, the board rotates!**
